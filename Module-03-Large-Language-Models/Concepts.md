## Week 3 – Day 1

### Session Summary

This session introduced advanced Large Language Model (LLM) concepts and their role in building intelligent AI systems. The discussion covered how LLMs work internally, including transformers, tokens, self-attention, context limitations, and embeddings. The session also explored vector databases, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), hybrid retrieval methods, multimodal processing (text, image, audio, video), and production-level application design using tools and agents.
Additionally, the session emphasized structured outputs using schemas, function calling, SQL integration, prompt engineering, evaluation strategies, regression testing, cost optimization, and commercial AI deployment practices.
